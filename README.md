# Switcher
Switcher is an OS X App which helps you easily switch AppleID in App Store & iTunes App.

If you use just one AppleID, this app may not be that useful for you. But if you use multiple IDs at the same time and thought switching between them hurt a lot, this may be the right app for you.

## Useage
1. Enter `cmd + n` or press menu item `Account -> Add Account` to add an AppleID.
2. Press `App Store` or `iTunes` button.
3. Enter the password for the AppleID.
4. Press enter and wait patiently.

PS. Right click a list item can choose to delete it.

## Is it safe?
The app saves your IDs in a local file and everytime you enter the password, for convience, it will save it in the memory(NOT in a local file). So feel free to use this app, it's totally safe. 

## Known issue
Certain states of App Store and iTunes App may cause the AppleScript part some error, but don't worry, click login again, it will work.

## Release
